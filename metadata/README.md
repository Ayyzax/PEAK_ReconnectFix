# Reconnect Fix
RECONNECT SAVE SYSTEM: Mod has been overhauled to fix fundamental error causing the reconnect issue, which has unlocked the in-built reconnect save data system.

When reconnecting you will now spawn with the same afflictions, items and at the same position as when you disconnected.

If you've encountered the issue pictured below when reconnecting to a game, this is the mod for you!

## Notes
This mod is client-side so this will only apply a fix for you.
